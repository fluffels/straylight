=========================


Instructions
------------

To compile the program, execute "make" in the root directory of the project. To
run the project, simply execute "./ray" while in the root directory of the
project. Executing the program will render the scene constructed through ray
tracing in an OpenGL window. Press any key to exit the window.


Command-line Arguments
----------------------

Pass --show to the ray program to show rendering progress. Note that this slows
down the process significantly.


Remarks
-------

The program is able to render a 1024x1024 image in around 2 seconds on a 3.4Ghz
machine. If it seems to not be responding give it some time / enable the --show
option.

The program has some problems rendering non-square images. If it gives buggy
output, try a square resolution.
