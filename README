====================


Instructions
------------

To compile the program, execute "make" in the root directory of the project. To
run the project, simply execute "./ray" while in the root directory of the
project. Executing the program will render the scene constructed through ray
tracing in an OpenGL window and then output this image to a file called
'out.tga'. Press any key to exit the window.


Command-line Arguments
----------------------

Usage: ray [options]

	-w		Set the horizontal resolution of the image to produce.
	-h		Set the vertical resolution of the image to produce.
	-o		Specify the name of the output file (default 'out.tga').
	--show		Pass this to view the image as it is being rendered.
	--cast-only	Pass this to disable output to a file.

Pass --show to the ray program to show rendering progress. Note that this slows
down the process significantly. Passing --cast-only will cause the program not
to write an output file. The -o <outfile> parameter controls the name of the
output file created by the program. -w & -h control the width and height of the
generated image (see Remarks below).

Examples: 	./ray -w 1024 -h 1024 		[Creates a 1024x1024 file called out.tga]
				./ray --show					[Shows rendering as it progresses.]
				./ray --show --cast-only	[Same as above, but no output file is
													generated.]


Remarks
-------

The program is able to render a 1024x1024 image in around 2,5 seconds on a
3.4Ghz machine. If it seems to not be responding give it some time / enable the 
--show option.

The program has some problems rendering non-square images. Unfortunately, I did
not have time to fix this. If it gives buggy output, or crashes, try a square
resolution.
