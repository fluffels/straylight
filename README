====================


Compilation
-----------

This project requires libpng 1.2.37, although it will probably work with
other 1.2.x versions.

To compile the program, execute "make" in the root directory of the
project.


Instructions
------------

To run the program, simply execute "./straylight" while in the root
directory. Executing the program will render the scene constructed
through ray tracing and write output to a file called "out.png".


Command-line Arguments
----------------------

Usage: ray [options]

	-w		Set the horizontal resolution of the image to produce.
	-h		Set the vertical resolution of the image to produce.
	-o		Specify the name of the output file (default "out.png").
	--show		Pass this to view the image as it is being rendered.
	--cast-only	Pass this to disable output to a file.

Pass --show to the ray program to show rendering progress. Note that
this slows down rendering significantly. Passing --cast-only will cause
the program not to write an output file. The -o <outfile> parameter
controls the name of the output file created by the program. -w & -h
control the width and height of the generated image.

Examples: 	./ray -w 1024 -h 1024 		[Creates a 1024x1024 file called
                                       out.png]
				./ray --show					[Shows rendering as it
                                       progresses.]
				./ray --show --cast-only	[Same as above, but no output
                                       file is generated.]
