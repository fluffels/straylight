Version 1.0
===========

Here is a sample profile for Version 1.0 of Straylight.

Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.

We can see that program execution time is dominated by Matrix
operations. getValue(), allocateMatrix() and setValue() will likely need
to be retained in some form since vectors will need their values changed
and memory allocated for them, but perhaps this can be done in a simpler
way.

getRowCount(), getColumnCount() and the contructor and destructor can be
eliminated.

Together, these account for 74.16% of the running time! They are therefore
the largest performance culprits. For version 1.1 an attempt will be made
to create a small and fast Vector3 class that does not depend on Matrices.
Since Vectors are small and are created on the fly and not stored, the
program will switch to storing them on the stack, rather than on the heap.


Version 1.1
===========

The switch to a simpler vector class had the desired effect. Dropping
execution time by a factor of 11x, measured by the execution times of
the 2048x2048 test run.

359.09 / 30.87 = 11.63

Most of the time is now spent in the dot operator. This seems curious,
but it is part of Sphere::testIntersection which is at least the second
highest time now Sphere::testIntersection, which is as it should be.

There still seems to be way too much time spent on Vector constructors
and copy constructors. There may be more work to do to optimize the
Vector class.

It's likely that because the Vectors are stored on the stack and are
constantly being copied into and out of functions these constructors are
taking so much time.

For the next major version it would be more advantageous to explore a
threading solution. This is after the minor change of adding a Colour
class.


Version 1.1.1
=============

This version added a Colour class to replace the use of Vectors to store
Colour values.

The addition results in even more OOP-related overhead. This project
may benefit greatly from the eradication of getters and setters and some
way to prevent the ubiquotous copying.


Version 1.1.2
=============

This version cleaned up the code a little, taking out some superfluous
getters and setters and presumably eliminating a lot of copying.

Each sample counts as 0.01 seconds.

Colour::get takes up more % of time, although it's absolute time is
down. Vector dot product and copy still take a lot of time, as does
getting magnitude. Perhaps there is some superfluous normalisation going
on? testIntersection may be too low, or the scene may be pretty simple.

All in all there's no glaringly obvious things to remove, as most take
about 0.6 seconds. The scene should be made larger so we have some more
data in terms of time. There's also the problem that this scene isn't
really representative because of its simplicity. The program would
benefit much more from threading at the moment.

Negligable performance improvements here. The OOP changes were made for 
the sake of simplicity though, so no harm done there.
