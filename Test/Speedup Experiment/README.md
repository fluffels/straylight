Questions
=========

1. Resolution vs accuracy of measurement

How well van we measure the accuracy of time differences between different implementations at different resolution scales. How can we find the sweet spot?

2. Resolution overall

Is it really necessary to measure at different resolutions? Do the performance scale linearly?

3. Samples overall

Is it really necessary to measure multiple samples if there is no stochastic element to the algorithms?

4. What nff files to use?

Since this race tracer only implements spherical objects, there is no need for testing with planes and triangles.

5. MD5's to check if the outputs are indeed the same.
